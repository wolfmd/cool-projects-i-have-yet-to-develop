**Name:** Virtual Reality Packet/Network Analysis
**Ideator:** Michael Wolf
**Overview:** A piece of VR software that would allow for the visual display and reactive manipulation of packets, their routes through a graph of a network, and the opening and inspection of their contents through hand motions. Kinda like Gibsonizing Wireshark.

**Notes:**
- Ideally reads in a pcap file and assembles a network graph with links representing requests
- Requests can be selected and opened in a way natural to humans unrolling a scroll
- Upon opening, the packet is displayed as a sort of sheet of paper with the headers at the top and the contents at the bottom.
