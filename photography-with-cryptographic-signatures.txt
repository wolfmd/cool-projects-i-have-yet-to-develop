**Name:** Cryptographic Verification of Photos
**Ideator:** Michael Wolf + Probably A Lot Of People 
**Overview:** With the rise of easily doctored photos, videos and audio, it has become
increasingly important to validate the source of images and the material that they contain.
One idea would be to use cryptographic signatures to identify the source device, location, time,
etc of a photo. This could be accomplished through using a manufacturer or a user's private key
which encodes the photo before it is uploaded (along with the public key-- automatically, I would
imagine) to a particular platform. The platform is able to verify the photo's metadata and list it
as a verified piece of media

**Notes:**
- It would probably stack nicely with a blockchain solution
- What is the optimal encryption paradigm?
- This would run into issues when malicious users falsify data but could be restricted to a certain
  degree by limiting the device of origin somehow
- Spoofing is still quite possible (and likely)
