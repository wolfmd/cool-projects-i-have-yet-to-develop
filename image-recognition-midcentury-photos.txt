**Name:** Image Recognition of Midcentury Photos + Geneology
**Ideator:** Michael Wolf + Jack Cox
**Overview:** After a talk on image recognition API's given by Jack Cox at Stir 
Trek 2017, I was inspired to develog a program to sort my archives with tags, a 
concept I had previously tried to do using manual techniques. Upon asking about
the use of image recognition systems in this domain, Jack Cox had mentioned a 
novel idea of using facial recognition to find family likeness. This would be 
incredibly cool but it's definitely over my head. Apparently a couple of these 
systems have existed, but it would be amazing to combine TensorFlow to the 
problem. 

**Notes:**
- It would probably be better to train my own model based on photos I tag rather
  than use systems trained on clear, modern photos.
- TensorFlow would work well.
- An early step could be simple cropping of photos
- There's a udacity course on ML
